## DISCLAIMER
I don't take any responsibility for blocked Discord accounts that used this cheat. If you try to use it, you'll either get banned from Discord, because self-bots are against the TOS, or you'll be banned from the Soccerguru bot.
I had never gain profit from the selling of this software and I'm posting it just to display something on my GitHub.
I enjoyed coding this bot more than playing the actual game, but now that the bot protection is more strict (finally, good for them), I'll stop developing this project. You're free to try it out at your own risk, but I won't explain how to install it: you'll have to figure it out yourself.
